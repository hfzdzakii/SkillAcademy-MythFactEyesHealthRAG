Sitting too close to a computer screen does not permanently damage the eyes — this is a fact. However, it can cause digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome, which is characterized by dry eyes, headaches, and blurred vision. These symptoms are usually temporary and can be alleviated by taking frequent breaks, maintaining a comfortable distance from the screen, and following the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet (about 6 meters) away for 20 seconds.

Exposure to ultraviolet rays from sunlight can cause eye damage — this is a fact. Ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight can increase the risk of various eye problems, such as cataracts, macular degeneration, pterygium, and even skin cancer around the eyes. Therefore, it is important to protect your eyes by wearing sunglasses that offer UV protection when exposed to sunlight.

Diabetes can cause diabetic retinopathy, which may impair vision — this is a fact. Diabetic retinopathy occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. This condition can lead to fluid leakage, swelling, and the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, all of which can impair vision and even cause blindness if left untreated. Proper control of blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol can help prevent or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy.

Changes in vision occur naturally with age — this is a fact. These changes include reduced ability to focus on close objects (presbyopia), decreased light sensitivity, and an increased risk of age-related eye diseases such as cataracts and macular degeneration. Although these are natural processes, regular eye exams remain important to monitor eye health and manage any conditions that may develop with age.

Excessive use of eye drops can cause dependency — this is a fact. Excessive use of eye drops generally doesn’t lead to physical dependence like addictive substances. However, the eyes may become accustomed to the added moisture provided by the drops, which can reduce the natural tear production. This may result in reliance on eye drops for continued comfort. Therefore, it’s best to use eye drops as needed and consult an eye doctor if necessary.

Smoking increases the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration — this is a fact. Cataracts refer to clouding of the eye’s lens, while macular degeneration involves damage to the central part of vision, potentially causing blurriness or vision loss. Smoking is known to damage blood vessels in the eyes, thereby increasing the risk of both conditions. Quitting smoking helps maintain eye health and reduces the risk of serious vision problems.

Eating nutritious food rich in vitamins and minerals helps maintain eye health — this is a fact. Nutrients like vitamins A, C, E, zinc, and omega-3 are vital for eye health. Vitamin A is essential for the retina and good night vision. Vitamins C and E have antioxidant properties that protect the eyes from oxidative damage. Zinc helps transport vitamin A from the liver to the retina for pigment formation. Omega-3s, especially DHA, are key components of retinal cells and help maintain pigment density in the retina.

Regular rest and eye drops can help alleviate dry eye discomfort — this is a fact. Dry eyes are caused by insufficient tear production or poor tear quality. Taking regular breaks from visually demanding activities like screen use or reading helps relieve eye strain. Artificial tears or lubricating drops can moisten the eyes and ease dry eye symptoms.

Every person’s eye structure is different — this is a fact. Eye features like pupil shape, iris color, eyeball size, and eyelid structure vary between individuals. These differences are part of natural genetic variation. Other factors such as facial structure and bone configuration can also affect how a person’s eyes appear.

Glaucoma is a condition where high eye pressure can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss — this is a fact. If untreated, glaucoma can cause gradual vision loss, starting from the periphery and progressing toward central vision. Regular eye exams are crucial for early detection and to prevent irreversible damage.

High blood pressure (hypertension) can damage the eye’s blood vessels — this is a fact. This condition is known as hypertensive retinopathy. High blood pressure can harm the blood vessels in the retina, causing leakage, swelling, or even bleeding. If not managed, it may result in serious vision problems or blindness. Maintaining blood pressure is essential for eye and vision health.

Babies blink less frequently than adults — this is a fact. Babies blink about 2 times per minute, while adults blink around 10–20 times per minute. The lower blinking rate may be because babies' eyes are more protected and less exposed to environmental irritants. Additionally, their intense focus on observing the world may reduce their blinking frequency.

Conditions like lupus can cause optic nerve damage — this is a fact. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can lead to inflammation and damage in various body tissues, including the eyes. Conditions such as optic neuropathy and lupus retinopathy may arise, leading to vision disturbances or even loss if untreated. Regular eye checkups are recommended for people with lupus.

Blood vessels in the eyeball help supply nutrients and oxygen to eye cells — this is a fact. The vascular network in the retina, choroid, and other parts of the eye plays a crucial role in maintaining eye health. The retina, in particular, requires good blood supply to function properly, and disruption can lead to serious vision problems.

The eyeball changes shape when focusing on nearby objects continuously — this is a fact. This change is temporary and due to a process called accommodation. The ciliary muscles tighten to thicken the lens and focus light correctly on the retina when viewing something up close. When looking at distant objects, the muscles relax and the lens flattens. These shape changes are normal and do not cause permanent alterations to the eye.

Applying cold compresses can reduce eye swelling — this is a fact. Cold temperatures can reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels, helping to decrease puffiness around the eyes. A cold compress can also soothe discomfort. Always use a clean, cool towel and avoid applying ice or overly cold items directly to the eye area.

X-ray radiation can damage eye cells — this is a fact. High or repeated exposure to X-ray radiation can harm cells in the eyes. As ionizing radiation, X-rays can damage bodily tissues, including eye cells, and cause various eye health issues depending on exposure level and area. It’s important to manage and monitor radiation exposure to protect overall health.

Sleeping with eye makeup on can damage eyelashes — this is a fact. Makeup like mascara or eyeliner left on overnight can accumulate and dry around the lash roots, leading to eyelash loss, follicle infection, or eye irritation. Clean your eye makeup gently before sleeping to protect lash and eye area health.

Rubbing itchy eyes can spread infection — this is a fact. Itchy eyes may be due to irritation or a foreign object, and rubbing them with unclean hands can transfer bacteria, increasing the risk of infections like conjunctivitis. If your eyes itch, it’s better to dab gently with a clean tissue than to rub.

Wearing contact lenses can increase light sensitivity — this is a fact. Especially if the lenses lack UV filters or protective coating. Some people become more light-sensitive after extended lens use due to changes in the eye’s natural light balance. Using high-quality, UV-protective, and comfortable contact lenses can help reduce this effect.

Reading in dim light will damage your eyes — this is a myth. In reality, reading in low light won’t cause permanent eye damage, but it can tire your eyes more quickly. Your eyes must work harder to focus, which may lead to temporary strain or discomfort, but not long-term harm.

Wearing glasses or contact lenses helps correct vision problems and prevent further issues — this is a myth. Glasses or contacts only correct vision while being worn. For some conditions like presbyopia or myopia, these aids are necessary to see clearly, but they do not cure the underlying eye condition or prevent its progression.

Eating a lot of carrots will quickly improve vision — this is a myth. Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which is important for eye health and good vision. However, consuming excess carrots or vitamin A doesn’t enhance your eyesight more than your body needs. Only the recommended amount of vitamin A is beneficial; excess intake offers no added advantage.

Eyes only need to be checked when vision problems occur — this is a myth. Eyes should be examined regularly, even without visible vision problems. Routine eye exams help detect disorders or visual issues early, when treatment is more effective. They’re also important for monitoring silent conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, or diabetic retinopathy, which may develop without early symptoms.

Spicy food can damage your eyes — this is a myth. Spicy food doesn’t directly harm the eyes. Some people may experience temporary reactions like watery or slightly irritated eyes after eating spicy food, but this is a natural response and not a sign of eye damage. Generally, spicy foods do not pose a serious or permanent risk to eye health.

Swimming causes nearsightedness — this is a myth. Swimming itself doesn’t cause myopia. However, frequent or excessive exposure to water can irritate the eyes, causing redness or stinging. This irritation is often due to imbalanced chemicals like chlorine in pool water. To reduce irritation, it’s recommended to wear swimming goggles and ensure the pool water is properly treated.

Wearing minus glasses can cure nearsightedness — this is a myth. Minus glasses don’t cure nearsightedness. They only correct the refractive error by helping the eye focus light properly. Myopia occurs due to an elongated eyeball or steep cornea, which glasses cannot change. Glasses simply allow clearer vision while worn.

Looking directly at the sun improves vision — this is a myth. Looking directly at the sun can severely damage your eyes. Exposure to sunlight, especially UV rays, can harm the retina and lead to conditions like keratitis or even permanent retinal damage that leads to blindness. Always wear sunglasses with UV protection under direct sunlight and never look at the sun without proper eye safety measures.

Dry eyes only affect the elderly — this is a myth. Although more common in older adults due to reduced tear production, dry eyes can affect anyone — including children and younger adults. Contributing factors include screen exposure and certain medical conditions. It’s important to recognize symptoms of dry eyes and take preventive steps regardless of age.

Sweet foods cause astigmatism — this is a myth. Astigmatism is caused by irregularities in the shape of the cornea or lens, not by diet. Genetics and eye injury are more likely causes of astigmatism, not sweet food consumption.

Wearing contact lenses while sleeping is not harmful — this is a myth. Sleeping with contact lenses is risky and not advised unless the lenses are specifically designed for overnight use. It can reduce oxygen supply to the cornea, increasing the risk of infection, irritation, and complications like keratitis. Consult an eye doctor to determine the safest type of lens if long-term wear is needed.

Looking directly at a laser beam is not harmful to the eyes — this is a myth. Direct laser exposure is very dangerous and can seriously damage the retina, potentially causing burns, permanent vision loss, or blindness. Always avoid direct exposure to laser beams and follow safety guidelines when using laser devices.

Rubbing eyes with mint leaves can cure red eyes — this is a myth. Applying mint leaves to the eyes is not recommended and won’t cure redness. It may cause further irritation or even infection. Red eyes can result from allergies, fatigue, or infection. The best treatment is doctor-recommended eye drops or cold compresses — never use unsterile substances.

All sunglasses offer good UV protection — this is a myth. Not all sunglasses provide proper UV protection. Lens color or darkness doesn’t indicate UV filtering capability. For effective sun protection, choose sunglasses labeled with 100% UV protection or UV400, which block all UVA and UVB rays.

Thick eye makeup protects the eyes from the sun — this is a myth. Heavy eye makeup doesn’t adequately protect eyes from UV rays. While some products may have SPF, they aren’t enough for true UV defense. Proper sun protection includes UV-blocking sunglasses and wearing hats or umbrellas to shield the face from direct sun exposure.

Reading in dim light is better than in bright light — this is a myth. Dim lighting is not better than adequate lighting for reading. For visual comfort and to avoid eye strain, it’s important to have proper lighting. Dim conditions make your eyes work harder, while balanced bright lighting (without glare) supports clearer focus.

Artificial tears can cure eye problems — this is a myth. Artificial tears do not cure eye diseases but offer temporary relief by moisturizing dry eyes or soothing mild irritation. They are not a substitute for medical treatment. If you experience chronic or serious symptoms, consult an eye doctor for proper diagnosis and care.

Reading glasses are only needed by older adults — this is a myth. The need for reading glasses isn’t limited to the elderly. Anyone, regardless of age, can develop presbyopia or near-focus difficulty and may benefit from reading glasses. The requirement depends on individual vision needs, not age alone.
